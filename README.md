# Morais Farmer's Market

A marketplace application to showcase items available for purchase at the farmer's market.

## How to Run

This application depends on Docker, so I will assume it is already installed, and that this repo has been cloned.

### Run as a CLI

The CLI provides an input interface for creating carts and producing itemized results.

> `docker-compose up market-cli`

```text

### Run as a Service

> `docker-compose up api`

 todo: show how to use curl to test against the API
