A marketplace application to showcase items available for purchase at the farmer's market.

Feel free to open `design.md` for a peek behind the curtain into my implementation decisions.

## How to Run

----
This application depends on Docker, so I will assume it is already installed, and that this repository has been cloned.

### Run the CLI

The CLI provides an input interface for creating carts and producing itemized results, much like a test client.

> `docker-compose build client`
> `docker-compose run client`

You will be given a command prompt with which to interact with the API, i.e. ...

```text
Commands:
   action : description
   ....

>>> CH1, AP1
```

### Run the API standalone

> `docker-compose up --build market-api`

 todo: show how to use curl to test against the API

### Run Tests

Tests may be executed using docker-compose, as well.

client tests:
> `docker-compose up --build client-tests`

API tests:
> `docker-compose up --build api-tests`
